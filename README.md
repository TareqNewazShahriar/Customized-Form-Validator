# Validator for Bootstrap 3 __Customized
Customized version of Validator v0.11.5 for Bootstrap 3 (originally by @1000hz, released under MIT License) <a href="https://github.com/1000hz/bootstrap-validator">repo</a>

Which working as a Fron-end developer for a SPA project, I selected _Validator_ for validating forms. As the project becoming complex, the Validator was becoming complex, highly modifyed and exhanced; As an example of enhancements- AJAX validation was added. Since this is highly customized so it wasn't pushed to the original repo as a pull request.
